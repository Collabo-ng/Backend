## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Node.js:** v14.x or higher
- **npm:** v6.x or higher
- **Database:** MongoDB v4.x or higher (or your preferred database)
- **Git:** Installed and configured

> :warning: **Important:** Ensure MongoDB is running before starting the application to avoid connection issues.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourorganization/collabo-backend.git
   cd collabo-backend

2.	Install Dependencies
    ```bash
	npm install


3.	Set Up Environment Variables
	•	Duplicate the .env.example file and rename it to .env.
	•	Fill in the required environment variables in the .env file.

cp .env.example .env



	:information_source: Tip: Use a .env management tool or service to securely handle your environment variables, especially in production environments.

4.	Run Migrations (If Applicable)

npm run migrate



Configuration

Ensure that all necessary environment variables are set in the .env file. Below is a sample of essential configurations:

PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/collabo
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
API_KEY=your_api_key

	:exclamation: Note: Never commit your .env file to version control. Use environment variables management practices to keep your secrets safe.

🔧 Usage

Starting the Server

To start the development server, run:

npm run dev

The server will start on the port specified in your .env file (default is 5000).

Building for Production

To build the application for production, execute:

npm run build

Then, start the production server:

npm start

	:warning: Caution: Ensure all environment variables are correctly set in the production environment before building and deploying the application.

API Documentation

Comprehensive API documentation is available via Postman Collection or directly in our API Docs.

🌱 Development

Branching Strategy

We follow the Git Flow branching model to manage our codebase effectively. Here’s an overview of our branching strategy:

	•	master Branch:
	•	Contains the production-ready code.
	•	Always deployable.
	•	dev Branch:
	•	Integration branch for features.
	•	Reflects the latest delivered development changes for the next release.
	•	Feature Branches:
	•	Naming Convention: feature/your-feature-name
	•	Purpose: Develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release.
	•	Bugfix Branches:
	•	Naming Convention: bugfix/your-bugfix-name
	•	Purpose: Fix bugs in the develop branch.
	•	Release Branches:
	•	Naming Convention: release/x.x.x
	•	Purpose: Prepare for a new production release.
	•	Hotfix Branches:
	•	Naming Convention: hotfix/x.x.x
	•	Purpose: Quickly patch production releases.

	:information_source: Tip: Always create feature branches from develop and ensure that the develop branch is up to date before starting new work.

Running Tests

We use Jest for testing. To run the test suite:

npm test

To run tests in watch mode:

npm run test:watch

	:warning: Important: Ensure that all tests pass before merging any pull requests to maintain code quality and stability.

Linting and Formatting

We enforce code quality using ESLint and Prettier.

	•	Lint the Codebase:

npm run lint


	•	Fix Linting Errors:

npm run lint:fix


	•	Format the Codebase:

npm run format



	:exclamation: Note: Adhering to linting and formatting rules helps maintain a consistent code style across the project.
